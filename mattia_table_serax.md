Fillet brazed steel lamp, partly inspired by Modernism's infatuation with steel tubing, partly by bicycle frame building, Mattia is a lamp that plays with balance and borrows elements from other realms. Originally handcrafted by an Italian bicycle frame builder. Fillet brazed steel lamp, single button actuation and dimming.
