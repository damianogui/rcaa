Metal plasma cutting allows for very precise slotting, eliminating the need for bolts and minimising the use of welding.
Copper is used both as a welding material and as a tensional "truss" element, and then filed down to a unique whole.
Exposing the copper through the horizontal and vertical surfaces renders explicit the choice of using the noble material as the structural element.
Placing the supporting element off-centre allows for gentle flexing of the steel.
The inner faces of the pieces are powder-coated (ochre for the table and blue for the bench) while the exterior is left exposed to use.
