Commercial version of the prototyped floor lamp developed of Serax. Fillet brazed steel lamp, single button actuation and dimming. Partly inspired by Modernism's infatuation with steel tubing, partly by bicycle frame building, Mattia is a floor lamp that plays with balance and borrows elements from other realms.
