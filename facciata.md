Design for a performative facade for the Braccialini fashion group's headquarters near Florence. Red expanded metal panels create depth and movement when perceived from the moving cars of the nearby highway. Designing for a fast moving observation point determined the blowing up of the elementsâ€™ scale brought considerations about pre-war modernism, optimistic car driven design to the point where the human becomes irrelevant, almost pure scenography.
