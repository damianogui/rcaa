Design of a family apartment. The house now revolves around a large, very blue and very multifunctional piece of furniture 
that separates the living area of the house from the sleeping side. Part kitchen, part walk-in closet, part storage, 
it is structure just as much as it is furniture. The rest is custom ligh fittings, a concrete-clad bathroom and some simple, 
white furniture.
