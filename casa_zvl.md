Simplification of a small apartment

The apartment was "simplified", all things deemed unnecessary to the occupant's lifestyle were disposed of. The daytime area, once divided, now fuses kitchen and living room in both space, materials and furniture. The bathroom contracts in favour of a large shower room, and natural light is brought all the way to the centre of the plan through a large glass wall.
The material palette is simple, economical and sturdy. Additional structural steel and concrete were left exposed.
