Coffee table based on the repetition of a single bent steel component
The table is part of a larger study on repetition and simplicity. 
A single geometry in bent steel is repeated and scaled to achieve both structural stability and a dynamic appearance with a single, 
simple elements. The tabletop is hand-painted with a geometrical motif echoing the structure supporting it.
