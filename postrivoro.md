Postrivoro is a cultural association working at the intersection between haute cuisine and art. Young sous chefs, barmen and designers for a pop up dinner in an unusual location.
We were asked to create an installation to last for a weekend, with a 100 euro budget, on the theme of recycling. Plasterboard profiles create a suspended curtain above the dinner table.
