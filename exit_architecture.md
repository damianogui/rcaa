Humans have been enshrining and memorializing their dead for millennia. While forms and rituals vary widely across cultures and religions, we are nonetheless reacting to similar desires: memorializing a life, coping with loss, religious symbolism, returning to nature, and so on.

EXIT Architecture is a speculative look at designing for the afterlife in all its potential architectural and design forms, and new ways of marking our exit. This exhibition presents a critical, projective, and speculative look at the present and future of this realm of design. EXIT Architecture features contributions from: AD-WO, Studio Ames, ANAH, BEAU Architects, Richard Ceccanti Aston, Bade Stageberg Cox, Roderick Cruz, JeongChoi Works, KONYK ARCHITECTURE, Giann Matias, Aleksandr Mergold, Michaela Metcalfe, Yongwoo Park, Jason Vigneri-Beane, and Lebbeus Woods.

EXIT Architecture is curated by Warren James, and Julia van den Hout + Kyle May.
