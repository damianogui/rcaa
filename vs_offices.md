The client acquired a disused shop and storage area next to its current offices. Research revealed the building, originally, was a candy factory. The projects radically transforms spaces,
functions and materiality of the building, taking somehow back to being a work environment. The interiors were heavily layered and revealed, once stripped down, a mixture of surfaces, materials and patched up solutions. We are adding only what is deemed strictly necessary (structure, circulation, furniture) and making it clearly identifiable: functional installations within a post-commercial environment, now again turned into a place of production, albeit of a different type.
