"Modernization" of a holiday home in Cortina d'Ampezzo. A holiday home left unused for decades, fixtures and spaces intertwined with childhood memories (to keep) and a completely new life to fit inside the walls (to change). What is old and what is new have to live together. All furniture is made of birch plywood, locally sourced and inexpensive. Local planning laws were esploited to modify the exterior of the 1960's chalet style building and allow more light and easier communication with the outside.
