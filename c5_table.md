Part of a series of objects exploring simple steel fabrication and geometric repetitions/variations.

The idea is to question existing furniture archetypes, to find new forms and functions, tvo create objects that have relevance, that hold their presence and value beyond the mundane, disposable possessions we have become so accustomed to. We want to propose a new approach to consumption of goods, their display, and the way our daily rituals develop around them.

2mm bent steel plate, enamel coated.
