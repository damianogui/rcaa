<p>Commercial version of the prototyped floor lamp developed of Serax. Fillet brazed steel lamp, single button actuation and dimming. Partly inspired by Modernismâ€™s infatuation with steel tubing, partly by bicycle frame building, Mattia is a floor lamp that plays with balance and borrows elements from other realms.</p>
