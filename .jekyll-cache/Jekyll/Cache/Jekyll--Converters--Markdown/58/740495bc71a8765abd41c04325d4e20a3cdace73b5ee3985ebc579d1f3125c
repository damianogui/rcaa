<p>A series of intervention in an historical building. Simple, white yet formally dynamic
objects are placed in contrast to the richly decorated ambience, creating mutual enhancement
rather than contrast, thanks to the ethereal, almost conceptual nature of the new furniture. 
The project is deployed on a large timescale to minimize the impact on the occupants of the house.</p>
