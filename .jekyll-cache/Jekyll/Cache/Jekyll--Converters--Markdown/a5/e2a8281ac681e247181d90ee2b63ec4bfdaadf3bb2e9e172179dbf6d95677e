<p>Small, ultra-simple apartment for a young couple. Filling the blanks with white.
Restoration of an apartment within an old city block, for a young couple.
The intervention was minimal in both scope and colour palette, favouring open spaces and light-coloured materials to enhance natural light. 
The peculiar plan of the flat is taken advantage of by creating niches and storage spaces along the passageways. 
All the original features of value or character were retained, while the rest of the structures and finishes were substituted with the clearest, lightest materials: white render, durmast timber and grey resin floors, as is filling the blanks with materials almost void of textures to enhance, via contrast, the dialogue between old and new</p>
