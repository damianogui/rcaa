Originally designed as a commission for the caf√© of the Museum of Modern Art in Bologna (MAMbo) the DM series revolves around a single structural element replicated and scaled to produce a dinamic stability. The structure is fabricated by a CAM hydraulic circuit machine fed by a simple excel sheet, so in a sense the pieces are not designed, but scripted.
