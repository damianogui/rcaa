Conversion of a barn into an apartment. The existing building was structurally unsound and called for demolition and reconstruction, which was blocked by the listed status it had acquired by default because of its age. The intervention aimed at stabilising the structure, by replacing the roof and inserting a sufficient amount of steel substructure both vertically and horizontally. The interior was "wrapped" in a second skin and the void filled with a special insulating foam. This left us with a blank void, which because of these conditions had lost all its connections with the envelope containing it, so the connection was re-established by selecting the existing materials (wood, steel, timber and concrete) all of which are contemporarily used in their raw state but expressed in a contemporary way.
